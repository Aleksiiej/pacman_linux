## Key Features:
- Object-Oriented Design: Fully implemented using Pythonâ€™s object-oriented programming capabilities, ensuring a structured and scalable codebase.
- Pygame Integration: Utilizes the Pygame library for rendering graphics, managing game states, and handling user inputs.
- Classic Gameplay: Mimics the iconic Pacman gameplay, offering a nostalgic experience with a modern coding approach.
- Linux Compatibility: Optimized for performance on Linux operating systems, ensuring smooth gameplay on a variety of Linux distributions.
- Design Patterns: Command, Game Loop and State Machine design patterns has been implemented in this project
- Multithreading: State Machine timer is implemented on secondary thread with use of python threading module

## Technical Stack:
- Language: Python
- Graphics Library: Pygame
- Development Tool: Visual Studio Code
- Platform: Linux

## Project Goals:
- Skill Development: Aims to refine Python programming skills and deepen understanding of game development principles.
- Library Familiarization: Provides hands-on experience with Pygame, enhancing knowledge of graphical libraries in Python.
- Personal Enjoyment: Combines the joy of gaming with the satisfaction of creating a playable game from scratch.
- Educational Value: Serves as a practical example for others interested in game development using Python and Pygame.

## Getting Started:
